      <h1>Strings in programming</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, we will learn about strings!
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>WTF is a string?</h2>
      <p>
        A string is a bunch of letters, numbers, and/or symbols that are joined
        together with quotation marks like this:
        "The force is strong with mah stinky breath!" or 'Mah candy!'. It's
        pretty much text! It's a string of text!
        Remember in the first section where we made our first program?
        We actually outputted a string that was "Mah candy!".
      </p>
      <h2>How to make a string</h2>
      <p>
        To make a string, we use quotation marks ("") or ('') and type in shit
        inside of them! We can also store strings in variables!
        Here's an example:
<pre>
<code>
name = "Angry Grandpa Tuba!"
</code>
</pre>
The string "Angry Grandpa Tuba!" got stored in the variable <strong>name</strong>
We can print the string by using print(name).
<pre>
<code>
name = "Angry Grandpa Tuba!"
print(name)
</code>
</pre>
We printed out the name of Angry Grandpa!
</p>
<h2>Concatenation? WTF is that?!</h2>
<p>
  Alright! Let's learn about concatenation and what it has to do with strings.
  Concatenation is pretty much linking strings together or even with variables!
  Here's an example:
<pre>
<code>
name = "Angry Grandpa Tuba! "
name2 = "He's the shit!"
print(name+name2)
</code>
</pre>
And we frigging get: Angry Grandpa Tuba! He's the shit! We use the + operator
to link, or concatenate the two strings! Very frigging cool!
</p>
<h2>
Escape characters
</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you may type a string in the manner of this:
<pre>
<code>
quote = "Angry Grandpa says, "Mah candy!""
</code>
</pre>
It looks fucked up in the window! Goddamn! To fix this, we can use
single quotation marks, like:
<pre>
<code>
quote = 'Angry Grandpa says, "Mah candy!"'
</code>
</pre>
Or we can use something called an escape character. An escape character is a
backslash (\) that we can use on the quotes inside of the string to make Python
go like, OK, these can be here! Jeez! Let's type the above code with the escape
characters:
<pre>
<code>
quote = "Angry Grandpa says, \"Mah candy!\""
</code>
</pre>
Pretty much, it allows us to use the double quotation marks inside the string
without fucking up anything. Sweet tuba!
</p>
<h2>Other escape tricks</h2>
      <p>
You can make some of the string go to another line, like this:
<pre>
<code>
quote = "The force \n
is strong with \n
mah stinky breath!"
</code>
</pre>
It will print like this:
<pre>
<samp>
The force
is strong with
mah stinky breath!
</samp>
</pre>
      </p>
<h2>
Turning numbers into strings and back!/Numberbots, transform and roll out!
</h2>
<p>
We can also turn numbers into strings, like they are Transformers!
Here's an example:
<pre>
<code>
age = 4
print("Mah age is" + str(age))
</code>
</pre>
It will say, "Mah age is 4". Note: if we did not put the str() function around the
age variable, we would get an error, because we cannot concatenate strings and
numbers together. It just doesn't frigging work! So we have to turn the number
into string format so no errors come up. We can also turn a string with a number
in it into a pure number as well. For example:
<pre>
<code>
int("4")
</code>
</pre>
This will turn the string with 4 in it, into the actual number 4!
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
You learned about strings and their awesome shit! They are pretty much text!
Tuba!
