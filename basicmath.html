      <h1>Basic math in programming</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, we will learn how to do basic math in a programming
        language.
      </p>

      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, Python can do math as well! You can add numbers, subtract numbers,
        and more! Here's a list of things you can type in the window and press
        Enter/Return:
        <ul>
          <li>3+4</li>
          <li>5-4</li>
          <li>8*5</li>
          <li>16/4</li>
        </ul>
        See? It gives you the solution to the math you typed in!
        There are more operators you can use, such as the modulus operator (%),
        which is the percent sign. The modulus operator when used, gives the
        remainder of a division problem, like 6%5=1. Type in 6%5 and press
        Enter/Return. It gives you the frigging remainder!
        You can also do exponents, by using two asterisks (**) between the
        numbers. Type in 10**2, then press Enter/Return. It gives you 100. Wow!
      </p>
      <h2>Order of operations</h2>
      <p>
        The order of operations also applies to math in programming. Remember
        PEMDAS (Please Enjoy My Delicious Alcoholic Sake)? The parentheses are
        first. The exponents are second. Third and fourth are multiplication
        and division in left to right order. Fifth and sixth are addition and
        subtraction, also in left to right order. Try this equation: (5+6)*3.
        Evaluate it on your own first and then type it in the Python window to
        see if you got the right answer. OK, how did you do? The answer was
        33, not 23. You do the math in the parentheses first!
      </p>
      <h2>What the hell is a float?!/Types of numbers</h2>
      <p>
        There are different types of numbers in Python, such as integers and
        floats. An integer is the same as an integer in math. It is a number
        with no decimal point, like 5, 10, and 45. A float is kind of the
        opposite. It does have a decimal point, like 5.6, 7.34, and 34.76. There
        are more types of numbers, like doubles, longs, and a few others, but
        those are kind of irrelevant to Python. Those are more common in other
        programming languages like Java and C++.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        You learned about math in programming and the types of numbers in
        programming!
