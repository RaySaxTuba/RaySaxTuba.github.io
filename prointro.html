      <h1>Hello Mah candy!</h1>
      <p>
      Welcome to the programming course! Here you will learn what it's like to
      program on your computer and write your first program, Mah candy!
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What is programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Programming is like making your computer do shit for you! A program is
        basically a set of instructions for your computer to do, like you can
        make it say "Mah candy!", which is what our first program will be.
        We will use Python 3.7 for this course, which the website is right
        <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a> for download.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the Python programming language?</h2>
      <p>
        Python is my favorite programming language ever! It was made by a Dutch
        guy called Guido van Rossum in the year 1991. I like how it makes
        programming much simpler and easier to do because of its very clean
        syntax, something that C++ can't really offer. Python is also known as
        an OOP (not Obviously Optimus Prime!) language. OOP means Object Oriented
        Programming, which basically means that you use objects in the language,
        and everything in the language is an object! But more on objects later.
        Let's write the frigging program already!
      </p>
      <h2>Writing the program</h2>
      <p>
        Assuming you downloaded Python and installed it, we are ready to
        rage/rock! Usually when you learn a programming language, you make the
        program say something like "Hello world!". We will do something similar
        but different as well for the hell of it! Find Python, open it, and type
        in the window that pops up this:
        <pre>
          <code>
            print("Mah candy!")
          </code>
        </pre>

        Now, hit the goddamn Enter/Return key! It said "Mah candy!". That was so
        easy! What happened is that Python outputted the text inside the quotations,
        such as "Mah candy!" You can also make it say other words or quotes,
        like "goddamn", "stupid", or even "Holy motherfucking shit!"!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
        You learned about programming and made your first program! Yay!
