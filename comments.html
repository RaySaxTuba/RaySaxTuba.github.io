<h1>Comments in programming</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, we will learn about comments and their purpose.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What the fuck is a comment?!</h2>
<p>
A comment is pretty much text that does nothing! Nothing! Ok,
before you assume it actually does nothing, it does have a
purpose in programming. They are used to leave notes or reminders
in the programming code for the programmer and other people that will
read the code as well. They do not affect the program's functionality in
any way.
</p>
<h2>How to make comments</h2>
<p>
To make a comment, use this symbol: #. This is used for single line
comments, which are comments that are a single line. Doh! Here's an
example:
<pre>
<code>
# This is a fucking comment! I don't do jack shit! But I am informative!
print("The tuba is loud!")
</code>
</pre>
See? The comment is there just for notes and other info. So they are
frigging useful! There are also multiline comments, which are comments
that are on multiple lines. Use triple quotes like (""") or (''') at the
start and end of the comment. Here's a frigging example:
<pre>
<code>
"""
I'm a
stinky fucking
toilet!
"""
print("Lies can also be used!")
</code>
</pre>
It only prints the shit in the print function. Not the comment!
</p>
<h2>What the fuck is a shebang?!</h2>
<p>
A shebang is basically a comment line that tells your goddamn computer
that you are using a certain version of Python so it won't get confused.
To type a shebang, type <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code>
at the top of the window. Here's an example:
<pre>
<code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# A fucking sexy shebang is above me! Tuba!
</code>
</pre>
So the shebang tells your computer that you are using Python 3 and not
Python 2 or any other version! I recommend you use a shebang like this
at the start of all your code!
</p>
<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
You learned about comments in programming and how they can be used to
make your code easier to read and understand! And you learned about the
sexy shebang!
